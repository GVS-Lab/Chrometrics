Introduction
============

The packing of the genome within the nucleus informs the cellular state. High resolution images of DNA as visualised using a fluorescent microscope is a convenient tool to characterize DNA organization. 

This package aims to provide an exhaustive set of interpretable morphometric and texture features for every single nucleus following segmentation from a 2D single channel image.
